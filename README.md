### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Suleiman Farah, I am a third-year undergraduate Computer Science Specialist student at the University of Toronto with a passion for data analysis and software development. I enjoy creating projects from different computer science disciplines (front-end, back-end, SQL, cybersecurity etc.) to help build a strong foundation of fundamental technologies and how they are connected.
